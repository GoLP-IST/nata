## Contributing to nata

For contributing to __nata__, simply fork this repository and apply your desired

### Local Development Environment

For the local development environment, we use
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). This allows us to ensure coding
standards without the burden of manually fixing and checking for styles. To
use poetry, simply install it using the latest version by running the following command in your terminal.

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```

Afterwards, simply run

```shell
poetry install
```

which will install all the dependencies (including development packages) in a
virtual environment. If you wish to run a command inside the virtual
environment, simply run

```shell
poetry run pytest tests
```

to run all tests available in the tests directory. Alternatively, you can directly use the virtual environment by running the command

```shell
poetry shell
```

which will spawn a shell inside the virtual environment.


In addition, we use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to help us keep
consistency in our development without extra burden. Please use it as well.
After you set up poetry, simlpy run

```shell
poetry run pre-commit install
```

which will create commit hooks for you and modify files keeping a consistent
structure.
