GridDataset container
=====================

The GridDataset container provides a sophisticated way to store information
about grids. In most cases, calling the class method
:py:meth:`.GridDataset.from_array` is recommended. The common way of creating
objects is as well available for GridDataset, but is reserved for advanced
usage.
