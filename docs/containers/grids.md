# Grid containers

Grids are represented in nata by a [`GridArray`][nata.GridArray] or by a
[`GridDataset`][nata.GridDataset]. Both objects can be seen as annotated arrays.
A [`GridArray`][nata.GridArray] represents a grid at one given time step with
labeled axes for each dimension. A [`GridDataset`][nata.GridDataset] represents
a grid at multiple time steps and can be seen as a sequence of
[`GridArray`][nata.GridArray].
